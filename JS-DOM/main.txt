JavaScript and the DOM
DOM: stands for Document Object Model

Definition of DOM: DOM is a programming interface that allows web developers to interact with web pages dynamically.

The web browser uses DOM to represent the HTML document internally. Additionally, it provides a set of functions and methods to modify the HTML document programmatically. These functions and methods are often called DOM API.
Role of DOM in web development.
 - Represents a document 
The DOM represents a document structure in memory as a logical tree, with nodes at the end of each branch.
 - Connects web pages to scripts
The DOM allows web pages to be connected to scripts or programming languages like JavaScript
 - Enables dynamic interactions
The DOM allows developers to manipulate the structure, content, and the style of a web page scripts.
 - Creates interactive experiences
The DOM enables dynamic, interactive web experiences.

 - Change the document's structure: Use DOM methods to change document's structure, style, or content.
 - Attach event handlers: Attach event handlers to nodes so that they are executed when an event is triggered.
 - Use DOM methods: Use DOM methods like querySelector, querySelectorAll, getElementBysId, getElementsByClassName to select elements.

Structure of DOM
DOM can be thought of as a Tree or Forest(more than one tree). The term structure model is sometimes used to describe the tree-like representation of a document.

Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. Event listeners can be added to nodes and the tree-like representation of a document.

One important property of DOM structure is structural isomorphism: if any two DOM implementations are used to create the same document, they will create the same structural model, with precisely the same objects and relationships.

Why DOM is called an Object Model? 
Documents are modeled using objects, and the model includes not only the structure of a document but also the behavior of a document and the objects of which it is composed like tag elements with attributes in HTML.

Properties of DOM
Window Object: Window object is object of the browser which is always at top of the hierarchy. It is like an API that is used to set and access all the properties and methods of the browser.It is automatically created by the browser.
Document object: It is property of window object.
Form object: It is represented by form tags.
link objects: It is represented by link tags.
Anchor objects: It is represented by 'href' tags.
Form control elements: Form can have many control elements such as textfields, buttons, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. 

Nodes in DOM (Interesting).
In DOM, nodes are the individual elements, attributes, and text that make up an HTML document.
    - Document Node: The top-level node that represents the entire HTML document.
    - Element node: Represents an HTML elements, such as <div></div>,<p></p>, or <ul></ul>
    - Attribute node: Represents an attribute of an HTML element, such as id, class, or src 
    - Text Node: Represents the actual text within an HTML document 
    - Comment Node: Represents an HTML comment.
