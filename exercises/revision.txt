## Practice Exercises

### Round 1
What is the difference between null and undefined?
1. By definition, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, whereas null is an assignment value, meaning that a variable has been assigned and given a value of null

What is the difference between arguments and parameters?
2. Parameters define the type and number of inputs a function can accept, while arguments are specific values passed to the function during execution.

How do you set default values on parameters?
3. In JavaScript, to set default values for a parameter, add an equal sign (=) after the parameter name, followed by the default value.

What are the string methods you know?
-concate(), indexOf(), match(), matchAll(), split(), trim(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase().

How can you change a string into an array?
By using split() method.

What is OOP?
OOP is a programming style based on classes and objects.
Mention OOP concepts you know.
-Abstraction, -Encapsulation, -Polymorphism, and inheritance.

How does this keyword behave in arrow and normal functions.
- With arrow functions there are no binding of this. In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be a window, the document, a button or whatever.

### Round 2
What are the different ways of declaring variables in JavaScript, and differentiate between them.(Follow up: hoisting)
- By using let, var and const keywords followed by the variable name of your choice.
Hoisting: is the default behaviour in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved at the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase.

What is the difference between slice and splice array methods?
slice() is used to extract parts of an array without modifying the original array whereas splice() is used to change the content of an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements.

What are the different ways of creating an object in JavaScript.
-Object literal, -Constructor, -create method, Object constructor, Object.create, Object.assign(), ES6 Classes, Classes

What is the difference between higher order function and callback function and give us examples of higher order functions in JavaScript you know.
Higher Order Functions, these are functions that accept other functions as parameters whereas callback functions are those functions that are passed as parameters in HOF.
Examples include: map(), filter(), reduce(), every(), some(), forEach()

Differentiate between call, bind and apply methods.
- Call method: Immediately invokes a function with a specific this context and arguments passed individually.
- Apply method: Immediately invokes a function with a specific this context, but arguments are passed as an array.
- Bind method: Creates a new function with a specific this context. It doesnot immediately invoke the function.

### Round 3
What is the difference between primitive and non primitive datatypes
Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned. Examples include: Number, String, integers, boolean, float, char, Undefined, Null, bigint, Symbol
Non-Primitive data types are mutable, meaning their values can be changed. Examples are Objects, Arrays, Strings, Classes, interfaces, ArrayList and HashMap

What is a callback function? This is a function that is passed as an argument or parameter inside another function(a higher order function);

What are arrow functions in JavaScript? How do they differ from regular functions?
Arrow functions are functions with a shorter syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. It was introduced in ES6. Differ, arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments, or super, and should not be used as methods.

Whatâ€™s the difference between implicit and explicit type coercion?
Type coercion, this is when JavaScript engines reads and understands the variable declarations and storage. Implicit type coercion happens automatically, while explicit type coercion is done intentionally by the programmer. converts the values from one datatype to another using functions like Number(), String(), Boolean().

What is strict mode in JavaScript?
Strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript which makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.

What is an object?
Object is a data structure that is used to store related data collections as key-value pairs.

Is it mutable or immutable? (explain mutability).
Mutability is when you can change something after being created. An object in general is mutable because it can be changed or modified after created. Also an object can be immutable when prevented to accept any changes for example using Object.freeze()

What is the difference between function declaration and function expression?
Function declarations are hoisted which means that they can be used before the function is declared. They are initialized at compile time. While function expression is not hoisted, they can only be called after the function is declared and read by the interpreter.

What is the difference between first-class and higher-order function in JavaScript?
First-class functions can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function, and can be assigned as a value to a variable. whereas higher-order functions are built-in functions that return a function and/or use a function as a parameter.

Difference between deep copy and shallow copy. How can you achieve both?
Definition: Shallow copy copies the top-level properties only. Nested objects or arrays are shared between the original and the copy. whereas Deep copy copies all levels of the object or array, including nested structures.

Mutability: shallow copy changes to nested objects in the copy affect the original and vice-versa. while deep copy changes to nested objects in the copy do not affect the original.

Performance: shallow copy is faster since it copies top-level properties. while deep copy is slower since it recursively copies all levels.

How to achieve each: Shallow copy can be achieved using - spread operator, - Object.assign(), Deep Copy can be achieved by using JSON.parse(), JSON.stringify(), custom recursive function, using libraries like lodash to provide a cloneDeep.

What is event propagation? What are the stages of event propagation?
Event propagation is the process by which an event moves through the Document Object Model(DOM) tree in JavaScript.
Stages of event propagation.
- Capturing: event starts at the root of the DOM and moves down to the target element.
- Targeting: The event reaches the target element.
- Bubbling: event starts from the target element and moves up to the root of the DOM.

What is the purpose of the switch case in Javascript?
The switch statement evaluates an expression where the value of an expression is compared with the values of each case in the structure.

What is for...of statement and how does it differ from for...in?
The for...of statement exexutes a loop that operates on a sequence of values sourced from an iterable objects.
The main difference is what they iterate over:
for...in: iterates over the enumerable string properties of an object. whereas
for...of: iterates over the values that the iterable object defines to be iterated over.

State 3 types of functions in Javascript
- Anonymous function
- Named functions
- Arrow functions
- IIFE functions: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions
- Calling functions

Explain hoisting in Javascript
Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their scope, prior to the execution of the code.

Why choose the bracket notation over dot notation when accessing object key to retrieve information? We can choose bracket notation over dot notation when accessing an object key to retrieve information when you need to dynamically determine the property name at runtime. where dot notation only works with static known property names.

What is the use of the string.substring method and how is it different from string.slice?
substring() is a string method used to extract characters from a given start index to the last given. Difference to sting.slice():
substring() with a negative argument ignores the negative and starts from the beginning while slice() starts from the end to start.
substring() with indexEnd greater than the indexStart swaps them and return characters. while slice() returns the empty string.
substring() with negative arguments returns empty string as it doesnot accept negatives while slice with act normal.

What is DOM?
DOM is a programming interface that allows programs to interact with web documents. It represents a document with a logic tree of nodes and objects.

How to select DOM Elements in JavaScript ?
Using getElementById.
Using getElementsByClassName.
Using getElementsByTagName.
Using querySelector.
Using querySelectorAll.

What is the difference between Java and Javascript
Java is an OOP programming language and its applications run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript is an OOP scripting language that run on a browser only.

How do you check the type of a variable?
By using typeof operator followed with the variable you need to check.

What is the type of array? Object. to check it, typeof, isArray, Array()

What is the difference between Nullish Coalescing and optional chaining?
Optional chaining allows for concise handling of potential null or undefined values. while nullish coalescing allows for default values to be assigned in the case of null and undefined.

### Round 7
What is the use of the string.substring method and how is it different from string.slice?

What is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression and why are they used?
This is a function that is defined and executed immediately after it is created.
Used: - to create private scopes.
    - Avoid polluting the global scopes
    - Execute codes immediately

In Javascript how do you check the type of a variable? typeof operator
What is the type of an array? Object... isArray, Array(), typeof()
Differentiate between mutability and immutability in variables.

What is asynchronous programming and what are different ways to achieve it?
Asynchronous programming is a technique that allows a computer program to run multiple tasks simultaneously, instead of waiting one task to finish before starting the next.
It can be achieved through various methods including: callback functions, promises, async.await syntax, event-based asynchronous patterns(EAP) and task-based asynchronous patterns(TAP)

To remove special character: use this pattern /[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]/g
