## ES6 Mental model session 29.01.2025

### What do you think about ES6 and ES5?
ES6 (ECMAScript 6) is considered a significant improvement over ES5 (ECMAScript 5) in terms of JavaScript development, offering a more concise, readable, and powerful syntax with features like arrow functions, let/const variables, classes, modules, and destructuring, making it the preferred choice for modern JavaScript projects while ES5 is still relevant for older codebases due to wider browser compatibility but is generally considered outdated for new development. 
Key points about ES6 compared to ES5:
Improved readability:
ES6 features like arrow functions and template literals make code more readable and easier to understand. 
Better object handling:
ES6 provides features like destructuring which allows for easier extraction of properties from objects and arrays. 
Modern module system:
ES6 has a native module system with import and export keywords, whereas ES5 requires additional tools for module management. 
Block-scoped variables:
ES6 introduced let and const which are block-scoped, enhancing code clarity and preventing variable hoisting issues. 
Classes:
ES6 provides a more structured way to define classes with the class keyword, making object-oriented programming easier. 
When to use ES5:
Legacy browser support:
If you need to support very old browsers that don't fully support ES6 features, you may need to use ES5 or transpile ES6 code to ES5. 
Simple projects:
For small projects where the added complexity of ES6 features isn't necessary, ES5 might be sufficient. 
Overall, while ES5 still has its place in certain situations, most developers should prioritize learning and using ES6 for new JavaScript projects due to its significant advantages in code quality and maintainability. 

### What is prototype inheritance is it in ES6 or ES5?
Prototype inheritance is a key concept in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. It is primarily associated with ES5, but it is still fundamental in ES6 and later versions.

In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called [[Prototype]], which links to another object. This forms a prototype chain, allowing objects to share methods and properties.

The prototype chain is a core JavaScript concept enabling the inheritance of properties and methods between objects. It facilitates code reuse, efficient property lookup, and object hierarchy creation.

### What is the difference between rest parameters and spread operators?
The Spread Operator
The spread operator, denoted by three consecutive dots (...), is primarily used for expanding iterables like arrays into individual elements. This operator allows us to efficiently merge, copy, or pass array elements to functions without explicitly iterating through them.
Use Cases(Spread Operators):
- Combining Arrays
The spread operator provides an elegant solution for combining multiple arrays into a single array. By spreading each array's elements within a new array, we can concatenate them effortlessly.
- Passing Arguments to Functions
The spread operator simplifies the process of passing variable-length arguments to functions. Instead of specifying each argument individually, we can use the spread operator to unpack an array of values into function parameters.
- Copying Arrays
The spread operator offers a concise method for copying arrays, ensuring that modifications to the copied array do not affect the original. By spreading the original array's elements into a new array, we create a distinct copy.

The Rest Parameters
    While the spread operator expands elements, the rest operator condenses them into a single entity within function parameters or array destructuring. It collects remaining elements into a designated variable, facilitating flexible function definitions and array manipulation.
Use Cases(Rest Parameters):
Handling Variable-Length Function Arguments
The rest operator simplifies the handling of variable-length arguments in functions. It allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments without explicitly specifying each one.
Array Destructuring
The rest operator is commonly used in array destructuring to capture remaining elements into a separate array variable.

Arrow Functions in JavaScript (ES6) üöÄ
Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) as a more concise way to write functions. They are especially useful for shorter syntax and lexical this binding.

Key Features of Arrow Functions
1. Implicit Return
If the function contains only a single expression, the result is automatically returned.
2. No Own this (Lexical this)
Arrow functions do not bind their own this. Instead, they inherit this from the surrounding context
3. Cannot be Used as Constructors
Arrow functions cannot be used with new. They don't have a prototype.
4. No arguments Object
Arrow functions do not have an arguments object.
When to Use Arrow Functions? ‚úÖ
‚úî When you need shorter syntax
‚úî When you want lexical this (e.g., inside callbacks)
‚úî When you don‚Äôt need arguments or new

When NOT to Use Arrow Functions? ‚ùå
‚úñ When defining object methods
‚úñ When using constructors
‚úñ When you need arguments

### (how does this keyword work)?
1. this in the Global Scope
In the global execution context (outside any function), this refers to:

The global object (window in browsers, global in Node.js).
undefined in strict mode ("use strict").
2. this Inside a Function
In non-strict mode, this refers to the global object (window).
In strict mode, this is undefined.

3. this Inside an Object Method
When a function is a method inside an object, this refers to that object.

4. this in a Constructor Function
When using a constructor function (called with new), this refers to the newly created object.

5. this in Arrow Functions
üöÄ Arrow functions do not have their own this. Instead, they inherit this from their surrounding (lexical) scope.

6. this in Event Listeners
In an event listener, this refers to the element that received the event.

7. Explicitly Setting this (call, apply, bind)
Sometimes, we want to control what this refers to. We can do this using:

call()
apply()
bind()
Using call()
call() immediately invokes a function with a specified this.
Using apply()
apply() is similar to call(), but it takes arguments as an array.
Using bind()
bind() does not immediately execute the function but returns a new function with this set.

8. this in Class Methods
In ES6 classes, this behaves similarly to objects and constructor functions.

üö® Problem with this in a Class Method If you pass a class method to an event listener, this can be lost:
### What do you think about template literals?
‚úÖ Why is this better?
No need for string concatenation (+)
More readable and cleaner
2. Multi-line Strings (No Need for \n)
Template literals support multi-line strings naturally.
3. String Interpolation (Embedding Expressions)
You can insert variables, expressions, or function calls inside ${}.
4. Tagged Templates (Advanced Usage)
You can pass template literals to a function, called a tag function, which can process the string before returning it.
5. Nesting Template Literals
You can even nest template literals inside each other.

### Types of Exports in ES6 üöÄ
In ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), there are two main types of exports:

- Named Exports
- Default Exports
These are used to export values (functions, variables, objects, classes) from a module so they can be imported in another file.

1. Named Exports (export)
‚úÖ Used to export multiple items from a module.
2. Default Export (export default)
‚úÖ Used to export a single value from a module.
‚úÖ You can import it with any name (no {} needed).
    üöÄ Key Points:
    No {} needed when importing a default export.
    The imported name does not have to match the original export name.
3. Named + Default Exports in the Same Module
You can combine both named and default exports in a single module.

4. Re-exporting (export * from)
‚úÖ Used to re-export everything from another module.

### ES6 Class Keywords: super, static, and extends üöÄ
ES6 introduced class-based object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript.
Three important keywords used in ES6 classes are:

extends ‚Üí For class inheritance
super ‚Üí To call the parent class constructor & methods
static ‚Üí To define class-level (not instance-level) properties & methods
1. extends ‚Üí Inheritance in ES6 Classes
‚úÖ Allows one class to inherit from another class.

When a class extends another class, it inherits all its properties and methods.
2. super ‚Üí Calling Parent Constructor & Methods
‚úÖ Used to call the constructor or methods from the parent class inside a child class.

- Calling Parent Constructor
- Calling Parent Methods
3. static ‚Üí Class-Level Methods & Properties
‚úÖ Creates properties & methods that belong to the class, NOT to instances.
    üöÄ Key Points:
    Static methods are called on the class itself, not on instances.
    
### Constructor Functions vs. Classes in JavaScript (ES6) üöÄ
In JavaScript, both constructor functions and classes are used to create objects.
However, ES6 classes provide a more structured and readable way to achieve the same functionality.

Difference Between Set, Object, Array, and Map in JavaScript üöÄ
1Ô∏è‚É£ Objects ({})
‚úÖ Used to store key-value pairs where keys are always strings (or symbols).
Key Features of Objects
Keys must be strings or symbols (not numbers or other data types).
Values can be any type (string, number, array, function, etc.).
Objects are not iterable (you can loop using for...in, but not forEach).
They are used for storing structured data (e.g., user profiles, configurations).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Arrays ([])
‚úÖ Ordered collections of elements (indexed values).
Key Features of Arrays
Elements are indexed (0,1,2,...).
Supports methods like push(), pop(), map(), filter().
Allows duplicate values.
Used when order matters (e.g., lists, sequences).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set (new Set())
‚úÖ A collection of unique values (no duplicates allowed).
Key Features of Sets
Only unique values (removes duplicates automatically).
Elements are unordered (no index-based access).
Provides methods like add(), delete(), has(), and size.
Useful for storing unique items (e.g., unique user IDs, tags).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Map (new Map())
‚úÖ A key-value data structure where keys can be of any type.
Key Features of Maps
Keys can be any type (numbers, strings, objects, even functions).
Maintains insertion order.
Supports methods like set(), get(), has(), and delete().
Used for structured key-value data where keys are not limited to strings.


## for..in and for..of loops.
for..in used to iterate over enumerable properties(keys) of an object. while for..of is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, and Nodelist

for..in not recommended in Arrays because it may iterate through indexes instead of values. while for..of can be a best fit for arrays.

for..in returns a property name(key/index) while for..of returns the value directly.
