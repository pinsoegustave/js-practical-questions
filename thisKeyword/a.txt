## Understanding JavaScript's `this` keyword in depth.

### this in the global context
Whenever `this` is outside any function it is a global object in the global context.

`this` is also a global object at the top level of a node. It is true only in a node repo

`this` on a normal top level of node module it is equal to module.exports 

### this in Function calls
the value of `this` in function is determined by how the function is called. This means it may return different values depending on how the function in invoked

when using plain function call and in strict mode, `this` is set to undefined

when not in strict mode, `this` inside a function is a global object. It returns undefined

"strict mode" prevents us to create global variables. And when we need the values in strict mode we add new operator to the constructor of the function.

### this in Constructor calls
when calling a function with new operator it becomes a constructor. Using `this` on a constructor it automatically creates an object.

using return in constructor function, we can overwrite the entire object, because the first is out of scope and no one still has its reference.
