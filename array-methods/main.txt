Array Methods Revision:
Arrays are special types of objects used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Array Creation: By using [] and Array() constructor

Array accessing: by using square brackets [] notation and pass the index. indices start from 0

Array updating: access element with it's index and assign it to the value you need

Array Methods one by one:

- length property: length property of an array returns the number of elements in the array. It is a property that automatically updates whenever elements are added or removed from the array.
- pop() method: removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
        It mutates the original array by removing the last elements
        If the array is empty(length is 0), pop() returns undefined
- push() method: adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
        It mutates the original array by adding new elements to the end.
        The elements are appended in the order they appear in the arguments list.
- shift() method: removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
        It mutates the original array
- unshift() method: adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array
- splice() method: changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.
        It modifies the original array and returns an array containing the removed elements, if any.
        Syntax: splice(startIndex, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...);
- indexOf() method: searches the array for the specified element from the beginning to the end. It returns the index of the first occurence of the specified element in the array.
        If the element is not found it returns -1
        Syntax: .indexOf()
- lastIndexOf() method: searches the array for the specified element from the end to the beginning.
- includes() method: checks whether a specified element is present in the array.
        It returns true if the specified element is found in the array, and false otherwise.
        Syntax: includes(searchElement, fromIndex)
- concat() method: is used to merge two or more arrays, creating a new array that contains the elements of the original arrays.
        It doesnot modify the existing arrays but instead returns a new array with the combined elements.
- reverse() method: is used to reverse the order of the elements in an array.
        It modifies the original array in place and returns the reversed array, with the elements in the opposite order.
- slice() method: is used to extract a portion of an array into a new array, without modifying the original array.
        It takes two optional parameters: start and end which specify the beginning and end of the slice, respectively.
        It returns a new array which containing the extracted elements.
        The original array remains unchangend.
- sort() method: sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.
        It modifies the original array and doesnot create a new array.
- flat() method: creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it.
