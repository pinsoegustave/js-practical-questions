## JavaScript Date and Time
In JavaScript, date and time are represented by Date() object. It also provides various methods.

#### Four ways to create a Date object.
- new Date
- new Date(milliseconds)
- new Date(Date String)
- new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds);

Date formats are: short date format and long date format

If four numbers are passed, it represents year, month, day and hours. For example,
similary, if two arguments are passed, it represents year and month
```bash
Note: If you pass only one argument, it is treated as milliseconds. Hence, you have to pass two arguments to use this date format.

In JavaScript, months are counted from 0 to 11. January is 0 and December is 11.
