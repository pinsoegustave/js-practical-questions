## JavaScript Date and Time
In JavaScript, date and time are represented by Date() object. It also provides various methods.

#### Four ways to create a Date object.
- new Date
- new Date(milliseconds)
- new Date(Date String)
- new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds);

Date formats are: short date format and long date format

If four numbers are passed, it represents year, month, day and hours. For example,
similary, if two arguments are passed, it represents year and month
```bash
Note: If you pass only one argument, it is treated as milliseconds. Hence, you have to pass two arguments to use this date format.

In JavaScript, months are counted from 0 to 11. January is 0 and December is 11.
```

JavaScript Date Methods
There are various methods available in JavaScript Date object.

Method	Description
now()	Returns the numeric value corresponding to the current time (the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC)
getFullYear()	Gets the year according to local time
getMonth()	Gets the month, from 0 to 11 according to local time
getDate()	Gets the day of the month (1–31) according to local time
getDay()	Gets the day of the week (0-6) according to local time
getHours()	Gets the hour from 0 to 23 according to local time
getMinutes	Gets the minute from 0 to 59 according to local time
getUTCDate()	Gets the day of the month (1–31) according to universal time
setFullYear()	Sets the full year according to local time
setMonth()	Sets the month according to local time
setDate()	Sets the day of the month according to local time
setUTCDate()	Sets the day of the month according to universal time

getMonth() and getUTCMonth() may produce different result due to DST(Daylight Savind Time) which is a practice that involves moving clocks forward by one hour in the spring or late winter, and then moving them back by one hour in the fall.
